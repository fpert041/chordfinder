# CHORDFINDER
============

A chord identifier C++ external for Max MSP


# WARNING: 
This repo is a work in progress!!!

## NOTE: 
This is not a self-contained project and should be used in tandem with my MaxCpp within the Max 7 SDK.
To compile iot and use it:

    1) download the SDK from Cycling 74

    2) download [MaxCpp](http://gitlab.doc.gold.ac.uk/fpert041/maxcpp) 

    3) place the SDK within the Max source path

    4) place this repo within the "MyExternals" folder inside MaxCpp



## REFERENCE: 
This project will probably use KISS_FFT, MaxCpp (my update on Graham Wakefield's original), the Chromogram/Chord detector algorithms defined by Adam Stark, as well as the Max 7 SDK (by Cycling '74) -- all the credit for these open-source files should be give to their authors
